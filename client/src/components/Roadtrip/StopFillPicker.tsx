/**
 * How full THIS stop fills up.
 *
 * A property of the stop rather than of the traveller, which is the whole reason it is
 * here and not only in the settings dialog: a motorway rapid charger is worth about 80 %
 * because the last fifth costs as long again, while the one at the hotel is worth all of
 * it because the car stands there all night. One figure for the whole trip cannot say
 * both, and the difference between them is a leg.
 *
 * Six pills rather than a slider or a field. A tank is not filled to 63 %, and the number
 * being chosen is a decision — "top up" or "fill right up" — not a measurement, so a
 * control that offers the six answers people actually give is one tap where a slider is a
 * drag and a field is a keyboard.
 *
 * Under them, what the choice is worth in kilometres, because 80 % is an abstraction and
 * "about 290 km from here" is the thing the traveller is actually deciding.
