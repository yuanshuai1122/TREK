/**
 * What a user does with the stays a sync brought in.
 *
 * Everything here is an explicit act by the person the suggestion belongs to.
 * That is the whole point of the split: the sync may look at a shared trip, but
 * only this service is ever allowed to write to one, and only because somebody
 * pressed something.
 *
 * Three destinations, deliberately not one:
 *   - **a place on the trip**, for a stay that was a stop worth planning around;
 *   - **a journal entry**, for one that was a moment worth writing about;
 *   - **a bucket-list tick**, for one that fulfilled a wish.
 * They are separate because accepting into the wrong one is a mess to undo, and
 * a single "import" button would have to guess which was meant.
 *
 * The trip UI offers the first two. A wish belongs to the Atlas — it is reached
 * once, and it is confirmed there, against the whole wishlist at once — so the
 * third is reached from the Atlas and from MCP, not from a row in a trip's rail.

   * marks the ones TREK already counts, so the list reads as "these are new"
   * rather than as a wall of things the user has known for years.
   *
   * Dawarich names countries rather than coding them, so the name is mapped
   * through the Atlas's own table. Anything that does not resolve is listed by
   * name instead of being dropped: a country TREK cannot code is still a
   * country the user went to, and silently losing it would be the worse bug.
