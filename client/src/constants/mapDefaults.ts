 *
 * The reason to offer these at all: OpenStreetMap and OpenFreeMap are thin
 * inside mainland China, and every foreign tile CDN is slow or unreachable from
 * a Chinese network. These are the tiles a Chinese user expects to see.
 *
 * `style=7` is the road map, `style=6` is satellite imagery. `lang=zh_cn`
 * because these are the labels the tiles exist for; an install that wants
 * English labels is better served by OpenFreeMap.
 *
 * A single host rather than the `webrd0{1..4}` shard family Amap also serves:
 * `{s}` in a Leaflet template is substituted from `subdomains`, which defaults
 * to a/b/c and would produce `webrd0a`. Every consumer of a stored template
 * would have to pass digits instead, and over HTTP/2 the sharding buys nothing.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: these tiles are drawn in GCJ-02, not WGS-84. Everything else in
 * TREK — every marker, route and bounding box — is WGS-84, and dropping one
 * datum on top of the other puts markers a few hundred metres off the street
 * they belong to. isGcj02Basemap() in utils/tileUrl.ts spots these URLs and the
 * map switches to the shifted CRS in components/Map/gcj02Crs.ts. Anything added
 * here that serves GCJ-02 tiles must be recognised by that predicate too.
