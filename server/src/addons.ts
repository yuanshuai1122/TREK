/**
 * The addons that gate an MCP surface, which is what decides whether switching
 * one off has to tear down the live sessions.
 *
 * A `when:` gate is evaluated once per session, at attach time. A client that
 * connected while an addon was on therefore keeps its tools registered and
 * callable after an admin switches it off — the gate never re-runs — while the
 * REST half answers 404 for the same user in the same moment. Only tearing the
 * sessions down closes that.
 *
 * Stated here rather than collected at import time, so nothing depends on which
 * modules a caller happens to have loaded, and guarded by a parity test that
 * reads the gates out of the source: as a hand-kept list this had already
 * drifted, and airtrail and collections were missing from it.
 *
 * MCP itself is on the list for a different reason — it gates the whole surface
 * rather than any single tool.
