/**
 * The browser half of list export and import (#2198, #2301).
 *
 * Both files are built by the server, which is also where the decision about
 * what may leave the instance lives (`collection-file.schema.ts`). This module
 * only hands one to the browser as a download, and reads a chosen file back
 * into something the import request will accept.
 *
 * A file that arrives here is a stranger's and is treated as one. A list file
 * is read locally, never uploaded, parsed rather than evaluated, size-capped
 * before parsing, and put through the shared contract so a field this build
 * does not know is dropped instead of travelling on. A GPX is size-capped the
 * same way and then sent as text to the server, which reads it with the XML
 * library the trip importer already uses and hands back a list file: one side
 * that parses XML, and it is the one that enforces the limits.
