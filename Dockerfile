# The trailing chown runs in this layer on purpose: it covers the manifests and
# the freshly installed node_modules while they are already part of this layer's
# changeset, so it costs nothing. Everything copied after this point carries
# --chown=node:node for the same reason — a recursive chown in a later layer
# would copy up every inode it touches and duplicate the whole tree in the image.
#
# No compiler in this stage. better-sqlite3 13.x carries prebuilt binaries for
# amd64 and arm64 inside its tarball, so there is nothing left to build: the old
# python3 + build-essential fallback compiled it against whatever Node headers
# the base image had that day, and 24.19+ headers give an addon that aborts with
# "Assertion failed: (env) != nullptr" the first time a statement is collected
# (#2421). --ignore-scripts because a lockfile-driven npm ci still synthesises
# `node-gyp rebuild` for the binding.gyp it finds, blind to the package's
# gypfile:false (npm/cli#9837). The only other install scripts among the runtime
# deps are esbuild's binary check, redundant next to its optional platform
# package, and a telemetry ping.
