 * the day ordering and the identity of a segment can, and they are exactly what

 * hues Dawarich itself uses for its track modes, which makes the two products
 * agree about a line the user has seen in both.
 *
 * theme-lint-disable — map paint: Leaflet path options and GL paint
 * expressions cannot read a CSS variable, and the map is the one surface where
 * a fixed palette is the documented exception (client/src/theme/README.md).
