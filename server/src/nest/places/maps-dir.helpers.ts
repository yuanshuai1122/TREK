/**
 * Reading the stops out of a shared Google Maps directions link.
 *
 * A `/maps/dir/` URL is a route somebody already planned: the stops are in the link
 * itself, which is why this needs no API key and no call to Google. Three shapes reach
 * us, and all three are somebody pressing "share" on a different screen:
 *
 * - the path form, `…/maps/dir/Berlin/Dresden/Prague/@50.9,13.5,8z/data=!4m…`, where the
 *   segments between `dir` and the viewport are the stops and the data blob usually
 *   carries a coordinate pair for each of them;
 * - the documented form, `…/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=…&destination=…&waypoints=A|B`, which
 *   is what the URL builder in Google's own docs produces;
 * - a `maps.app.goo.gl` short link, which is either of the above after one redirect —
 *   followed by the caller, because following it is a network call and this file makes
 *   none.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. What it cannot answer — a stop that is only a name — it says
 * so about, and the caller geocodes it.
