/**

 *
 * Credentials live in `dawarich_connections` rather than in more `users`
 * columns. AirTrail put its four on `users` and said so out loud — correct while
 * it was the only integration of that shape, and this is the second one. The
 * deciding difference is that this connection carries state (last sync, last
 * error, probed capabilities) that belongs to a sync, not to an identity, and
 * that a personal location archive is the one credential worth keeping furthest
 * from the row every other feature joins against.
 *
 * The key is encrypted at rest and never leaves again: `getConnection` returns a
 * mask, and there is no route that reads it back.
