/**
 * The journey's own figures, as things you can put on a page.
 *
 * This is the panel that makes Studio a *travel* book designer rather than a
 * layout tool that happens to be full of holiday photographs. The route, the
 * distance, the countries and the dates are already in TREK; the work is
 * offering them as objects rather than as numbers someone has to retype.
 *
 * ── Why every tile is a real preview ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * These elements differ from one another by what they *say*, not by their
 * shape. Four map styles are four maps; three summary layouts are the same six
 * numbers arranged three ways. A named row with the value beside it — which is
 * what this panel was first — tells you none of that: you cannot tell the dark
 * map from the paper one, or a row of figures from a grid of them, until you
 * have placed one and undone it.
 *
 * So each tile builds the element it would place and renders it through the
 * page's own renderer, with this journey's real numbers in it. You are picking
 * from the things themselves.
 *
 * Every button resolves its values *now* and writes them into the element, so
 * what lands on the page is finished rather than a placeholder that needs the
 * server to mean anything. The reasoning is in TravelElements.tsx, and the
 * short version is that the print renderer must never depend on a fetch.
