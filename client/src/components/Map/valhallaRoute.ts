/**
 * Valhalla, the second routing engine, asked only the questions OSRM cannot answer.
 *
 * The shipped OSRM hosts are built without excludable road classes: their car profile
 * says so in its own Lua ("no memory for classes on demand server"), and `exclude=`
 * comes back as HTTP 400 on every leg. So the one thing a road tripper keeps asking
 * for — drive this without the tolls — has never worked on a default install.
 *
 * FOSSGIS runs a public Valhalla on the whole planet next to it, keyless, and there
 * avoidance is a runtime weighting rather than a profile that has to be rebuilt. This
 * module is the adapter: same question, different engine, answer shaped like the OSRM
 * one so the callers do not have to care which engine spoke.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a replacement for the OSRM path. Three measured reasons:
 *   - it caps at ten locations, and following a track sends a day's stops plus up to
 *     nine anchors, so the bundled requests would start failing;
 *   - it refuses a point it cannot bind to a road, where OSRM still snaps one. The
 *     Stephansdom, in a pedestrian zone, answers `No path could be found for input`
 *     until a search radius is allowed;
 *   - it prices roads differently, and not by a constant anybody could correct for.
 *     Over twelve European legs the per-leg drive time ran from 14.7 % under OSRM's to
 *     13.2 % over, and the sign follows the region rather than the road: on Spanish
 *     autovía Valhalla is the faster of the two on every leg measured, through a city
 *     it is half again slower. Those times feed the arrival clocks of a road trip day,
 *     so mixing engines inside one chain would move times nobody asked to move, and
 *     subtracting one engine's figure from the other's, which is what an offer beside
 *     a route invites, measures the gap between two speed models and nothing else.
 *
 * Which leaves exactly the shape this module serves: two points, one avoidance, asked
 * on demand, drawn as an offer next to the route rather than replacing it.
