/**
 * The MCP half of GET /api/plugin-search (#2221).
 *
 * The browser merges the plugin hits into its own search list, so a person searching
 * for a hotel sees the installed index alongside OpenStreetMap without asking. An
 * assistant calling `search_place` saw only TREK's own indexes, which is the same
 * asymmetry `get_trip_warnings` exists to close: what the user can see, the assistant
 * has to be able to see.
 *
 * A tool of its own rather than a section of `search_place`, for the reason spelled out
 * in trip-warnings.mcp.ts: `search_place` lives in PlacesModule, the plugin runtime
 * already imports PlacesModule, and reaching the hooks from there would close a module
 * cycle. It is also a different cost — an IPC round trip into every installed provider
 * with a four-second budget, against a synchronous call into the maps service.
