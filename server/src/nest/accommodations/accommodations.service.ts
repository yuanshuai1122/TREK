 * assignment: the rail, the server-side plan and the map all build their stops
 * from day_assignments and only look the stay up afterwards, to hang check-in
 * and check-out on one. A stay written without an assignment is therefore
 * invisible to every routing surface, which is what made people enter their
 * hotel a second time as an ordinary place. The road-trip side has always
 * written both halves in one go (the place, its day, and the stay); this is the
 * day planner catching up, in the domain that writes the stay, so the next
