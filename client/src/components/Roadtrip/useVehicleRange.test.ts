/**
 * Seven settings assembled into one answer.
 *
 * The arithmetic is pinned next door in vehicleRange.test.ts; what is worth guarding
 * here is the assembly: that an unrecognised word is no vehicle rather than a vehicle
 * nobody can refuel, that every one of the parts really reaches the division, and that
 * a range which rounds away arrives as no limit rather than as a zero one.
 *
 * The identity cases are worth less than they look, and are kept small for that reason.
 * Every reader today destructures the object on the spot, so its reference reaches
 * nothing; what they guard is the day a reader stops doing that.
