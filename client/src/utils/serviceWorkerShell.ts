 * carried from release to release. A broken script at least fails its import,
 * and the app recovers from that (chunkReload, shell-guard.js). A broken
 * stylesheet, font or icon raises no error at all: the app just loses its
 * layout or its typeface, on every launch, and offline too.
 *
 * Each such entry is fetched from the server again and put back in its place.
 * One the server does not have is removed, so the file is asked for on the
 * network and the next install stores it. When a fetch fails, the rest is left
 * for the next launch. A precache found sound is not looked at again until its
