 * Only these switches fold away. The key fields above stay visible: a field you
 * have to go looking for is worse than a long page, and the keys are the reason
 * an admin opens this card at all. The switches are the opposite — set once,
 * then never touched, and there are five of them.
 *
 * A native <details> rather than a state hook: keyboard operable and announced
 * to screen readers without writing any of that, and it survives a re-render
 * without state.
