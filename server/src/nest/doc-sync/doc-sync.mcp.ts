/**
 * The MCP half of document sync, mirroring /api/trips/:tripId/docsync.
 *
 * Read and trigger only. There is no tool that creates a connection, and that
 * is deliberate rather than unfinished: setting one up means handing over a
 * credential that usually reaches a person's entire document archive, and an
 * assistant is the wrong place to collect one. The same reason the REST side
 * restricts those routes to the trip owner applies twice over here.
 *
 * `sync_trip_documents` is a write because it moves files in both directions,
 * even though it creates nothing itself.
