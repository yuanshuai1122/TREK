/**
 * FE-STOPFILL-001..010 — how full one stop fills, as opposed to how full they all do.
 *
 * The figure is two-sided: a stop either has its own or borrows the traveller's, and the
 * panel has to open showing which. What is worth pinning is the seam between them —
 * that an inherited figure reads as chosen, that picking it again hands the stop back to
 * the setting rather than writing the same number, and that the kilometre line under the
 * pills is absent rather than invented when no range is set.
