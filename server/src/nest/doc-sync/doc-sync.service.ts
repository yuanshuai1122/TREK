 * (a rename, or a move where ids are paths) stayed on the issues list for one
 * more run. `error` is left alone on purpose: that row either never got its
 * bytes or holds older ones than the provider, and calling it synced would hide

/**
 * The reconciler: it executes what `planReconcile` decided, and does nothing

 *
 * It enumerates both sides in full on every run rather than asking for a delta.
 * That looks wasteful and is deliberate. A changed-since query cannot see a
 * deletion at all; Papra does not bump `updatedAt` when a tag changes (measured,
 * not assumed); Paperless's bulk edit changes documents without touching
 * `modified`; and Synology FileStation has no change feed whatsoever. A webhook
 * is therefore only ever "look now", never a source of truth: the same
 * conclusion AirTrail and Dawarich reached for their own providers, written
 * down in dawarich-sync.service.ts.
 *
 * Two safety rules outrank everything else here:
 *   1. A document that disappears upstream is RECORDED as missing. It is never
 *      deleted locally as a side effect. An unmounted share answers with an
 *      empty listing, and a trip is not a cache.
 *   2. TREK's own writes must not come back as foreign changes. That is what
 *      `pushed_sha256` is for, and why the comparison is over content rather
 *      than over timestamps.
