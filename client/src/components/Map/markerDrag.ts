/**
 * Dragging a place off the map onto a day in the itinerary (#891).
 *
 * The drop half of this already existed: every day, every row and every gap
 * between rows in the day plan reads a `placeId` and calls onAssignToDay with
 * the position it was dropped at. All that was missing was a second place to
 * pick a place UP from — until now the only one was the row in the places
 * sidebar. This makes a map marker behave exactly like that row.
 *
 * `window.__dragData` is set alongside dataTransfer on purpose, and is not
 * belt-and-braces: browsers hide dataTransfer's contents during `dragover`, so
 * a drop target that wants to know what is coming while it hovers has no other
 * way to look. The day plan reads both (getDragData), and this mirrors what
 * PlacesSidebarRow already does so the two sources are indistinguishable to it.
 *
 * Both renderers get the same treatment through this one helper: Leaflet builds
 * its markers from divIcon HTML and the GL renderers from createElement, but
 * both end up as a real DOM node, which is all HTML5 drag needs.
