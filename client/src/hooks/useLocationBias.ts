/**
 * Where the user is planning right now, as a hint for the place search.
 *
 * Without it the search cannot tell which of a thousand identically named
 * places is meant: "Hase-dera" returns the temple in Nara rather than the one
 * in Kamakura, and a common single word is refused by the index as too
 * expensive to answer, which drops the search back to Nominatim alone.
 *
 * The hint has to be NARROW, and that is the part that is easy to get wrong.
 * Measured over 126 places of a real trip through Japan, searched against a
 * live instance:
 *
 *   no hint at all                      54.8% found, 38.1% at rank 1
 *   box around the WHOLE trip           57.1% found, 17.5% at rank 1
 *   box around the nearest few places   70.6% found, 34.9% at rank 1
 *
 * A box spanning a whole round trip has its centre somewhere between the
 * cities, points at nothing, and costs more rank-1 hits than it gains. It is
 * worse than no hint. So the day being planned comes first, and a hint that
 * ends up wider than a metropolitan area is dropped rather than sent.
