 *    fetched them. A place or a journal entry appears only when that person
 *    accepts one, in `DawarichSuggestionsService`.
 * 2. **Repeating a sync is free.** Identity is (user, Dawarich visit id) with a
 *    UNIQUE behind it, so the tenth run over the same window produces the same
 *    rows as the first.
 * 3. **The source is allowed to change its mind; TREK is not allowed to act on
 *    that alone.** A visit whose content hash moved is flagged `source_changed`
 *    and one that vanished from a full re-read is flagged `source_missing` —
 *    both visible, neither applied. A suggestion the user already accepted and
 *    then edited is their text now; rewriting or deleting it because a detector
 *    ran again would be the integration overwriting someone's journal.
