# MCP Tools and Resources

TREK exposes **tools** (read and write actions) and **resources** (read-only `trek://` URIs). Tools are registered per-session based on OAuth scopes and enabled addons.

Every built-in tool checks its arguments against its published schema before anything runs. An argument the tool does not declare (a misspelt field such as `stopType` for `stop_type`) is refused with `Unrecognized key`, so the AI sees the mistake and can retry rather than reporting a change that never happened. Plugin-contributed tools follow the schema their manifest declares.

For addon-gated tools (Packing, To-Dos, Atlas, Collab, Collections, Vacay, Journey, Dawarich, Document sync, Road trip) and their resources, see [MCP-Addon-Tools](MCP-Addon-Tools).

## Tools

### Trip Summary

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_trip_summary` | Full denormalized snapshot of a trip — metadata, members, days with assignments and notes, accommodations, budget, packing, reservations, collab notes, and to-dos in one call. Use this as your context loader before making changes. |

### Compound tools

Compound tools collapse multi-step workflows into a single atomic transaction. If the second step fails, the first is rolled back.

> Use compound tools only when the place or item does not yet exist. For existing records, call the individual tools directly.

| Tool | Wraps | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `create_and_assign_place` | `create_place` + `assign_place_to_day` | Create a place and assign it to a day. Takes the same place fields as `create_place`, `stop_type` included. Returns `{ place, assignment }`. Requires `places:write`. |
| `create_place_accommodation` | `create_place` + `create_accommodation` | Create a place and book it as an accommodation. Returns `{ place, accommodation }`. Requires `trips:write`. |
| `create_budget_item_with_members` | `create_budget_item` + `set_budget_item_members` | Create a budget item and set splitting members. If `userIds` is omitted, behaves like `create_budget_item`. Returns `{ item }`. Requires `budget:write`. |

### Trips

Requires `trips:read` or `trips:write` scope.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_trips` | List all trips you own or are a member of. Supports `include_archived` flag. |
| `create_trip` | Create a trip with title, dates, and currency. Days are auto-generated from the date range. Without a currency the trip takes your display currency (Settings → General, or the admin's User Defaults preset), and EUR when that is left on *Trip currency*; see [Currencies](Currencies). |
| `update_trip` | Update a trip's title, description, dates, or currency. Day plans follow their position, so dates that hold fewer days remove the last days with what is on them, also when only the start moved later. Every day a change removes is listed in `removed_days`, with its id, number and date as they stood before and a reason: `overflow` for a day past the new range, `spare` for an empty day without a date. |
| `search_cover_images` | Search Unsplash for candidate cover photos and return their URLs, thumbnails and photographer credits. Nothing is saved; pass the chosen photo's URL to `update_trip` as `cover_image`. |
| `delete_trip` | Delete a trip. Owner only. Requires `trips:delete`. |
| `list_trip_members` | List the owner and all collaborators of a trip. |
| `add_trip_member` | Add a user to a trip by username or email. Owner only. |
| `remove_trip_member` | Remove a collaborator from a trip. Owner only. |
| `leave_trip` | Leave a trip you were invited to, giving up your own access. Use this rather than `remove_trip_member` when the user means themselves. The owner cannot leave their own trip. Requires `trips:write`. |
| `create_trip_guest` | Add a travelling companion who has no TREK account. Assignable to budget splits, packing and day participants; never signs in, never emailed. Owner only. |
| `rename_trip_guest` | Rename a guest on a trip. Owner only. |
| `delete_trip_guest` | Delete a guest and re-split the expenses they were part of. Owner only. |
| `copy_trip` | Duplicate a trip (days, places, itinerary, packing, budget, reservations). Packing items reset to unchecked. |
| `export_trip_ics` | Export the trip itinerary and reservations as iCalendar (`.ics`) text. |
| `get_share_link` | Get the current public share link for a trip and its permission flags. Requires `trips:share`. |
| `create_share_link` | Create or update the public share link with configurable visibility flags. Requires `trips:share`. |
| `delete_share_link` | Revoke the public share link for a trip. Requires `trips:share`. |

### Places

Requires `places:read` or `places:write` scope.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_places` | List places in a trip, optionally filtered by assignment status, category, tag, or search query. |
| `create_place` | Add a place with name, coordinates, address, category, notes, website, phone, and optional `google_place_id` / `osm_id`. An optional `stop_type` (`fuel`, `charging`, `rest_area`, `campsite`, `restaurant`, `sights` or `hotel`) marks it as a service stop on a drive rather than a destination, so it is left out of the day's stop count; see [Road-Trip](Road-Trip). Leave it unset for an ordinary place. |
| `update_place` | Update any field of an existing place including transport mode, timing, price and `stop_type`. Pass `stop_type: null` to turn a service stop back into an ordinary place. |
| `rate_place` | Set or clear your own 1–5 star rating on a place. Every trip member rates independently and the place shows the average. Pass `null` to clear the vote. |
| `bulk_update_places` | Update many places at once, applying the same field values (e.g. category, price, transport mode, `stop_type`) to every listed place in a single call. `stop_type: null` turns the listed service stops back into ordinary places. |
| `delete_place` | Remove a place from a trip. Also removes all day assignments, the expenses linked to the place and any night booked at it, together with that night's reservation and the reservation's expense. Cannot be undone, so an assistant should warn before deleting a hotel that holds a booking. |
| `bulk_delete_places` | Delete multiple places by ID. Removes all day assignments, linked expenses and any nights booked at each place, with their reservations and expenses. Cannot be undone. |
| `import_places_from_url` | Import all places from a publicly shared Google Maps or Naver Maps list URL. |
| `list_categories` | List all available place categories with id, name, icon, and color. |
| `create_category` | Add a category to the instance-wide palette, with name, hex colour and emoji icon. Every trip on the instance sees it, so prefer an existing one from `list_categories`. Admin only; a non-admin gets `Admin access required`. Requires `places:write`. |
| `update_category` | Rename a category or change its colour or icon. Every place already carrying it follows the change. Admin only. Requires `places:write`. |
| `delete_category` | Remove a category from the palette. Places keep their data but lose the category, across every trip. Admin only. Requires `places:write`. |
| `search_place` | Search for a place by name or address, the way the full search in the app does: TREK's own place index and OpenStreetMap together, and Google or Amap only when both are empty. Returns `osm_id` (and `google_place_id` / `google_ftid` when Google answered) for use in `create_place`. Takes an optional `locationBias` to rank results around the trip's destination, and an optional `provider: 'google'` that sends this one search to Google Places alone, the same as the **Search Google instead** line under a result list in the app; it is ignored unless Google holds the keyed slot: an instance without a Google key, or one whose admin picked Amap or OpenStreetMap as the places provider, answers from the index and OpenStreetMap as usual. With the admin switch **Search with Google only** on (see [Places-and-Search](Places-and-Search#with-a-google-maps-api-key)), every call goes to Google whatever is passed, and the index and OpenStreetMap are never asked, so no result carries an `osm_id`. |
| `search_places_via_plugins` | Search the place indexes installed plugins provide, alongside `search_place` rather than instead of it. Results have the shape `search_place` returns plus a `rating` and the `pluginId` that found them; only these results can carry a rating. Empty when no plugin offers a search index. Requires `places:read`. |

### Day Planning

Requires `trips:read` or `trips:write` scope.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `update_day` | Set or clear a day's title. |
| `create_day` | Add a new day to a trip with optional date and notes. With `position` an empty day is slotted in at that place. With `dated` the trip grows by the calendar day after its last date: the new day gets that date and goes right behind the last dated day, days without a date move one place back, and the end date of the trip moves to the new day. `dated` only works on a trip with dates, is refused once the trip spans 999 days, and cannot be combined with `date` or `position`; its result carries the updated `trip` next to the `day`. |
| `delete_day` | Delete a day from a trip. Its places stay in the place list, its notes and texts go, and bookings on it stay without a day. A stay that checks in or out on the day is cancelled with its booking and expense; a stay that only runs across the day is kept. Later days move up one place; on a dated trip they and their bookings take the date one slot earlier, and the trip ends a day earlier when no day without a date is left to take the last date. The last day of a trip cannot be deleted. |
| `reorder_days` | Reorder whole days by listing every day ID of the trip in the desired order. Each day keeps its places, notes, stays and bookings; on a dated trip the dates stay pinned to their slots, so the content moves across them. For places inside one day use `reorder_day_assignments`. Requires `trips:write`. |
| `set_day_default_transport_mode` | Set the whole-day default travel mode. Per-leg modes still override it. Pass `null` to clear. |
| `assign_place_to_day` | Pin a place to a specific day in the itinerary. Requires `places:write`. |
| `unassign_place` | Remove a place assignment from a day. Requires `places:write`. |
| `reorder_day_assignments` | Reorder places within a day by providing assignment IDs in order. Requires `places:write`. |
| `update_assignment_time` | Set start/end times for a place assignment (e.g. `"09:00"` – `"11:30"`). Pass `null` to clear. Requires `places:write`. |
| `move_assignment` | Move a place assignment to a different day. Requires `places:write`. |
| `update_assignment_notes` | Set or clear the day-specific note on a place assignment, the one `assign_place_to_day` and `create_and_assign_place` accept at creation. Pass `null` or an empty string to clear it. Requires `places:write`. |
| `set_leg_transport_mode` | Set the travel mode of a route leg for a place assignment. `direction` `"outgoing"` (default) targets the leg leaving the stop, `"incoming"` the arriving one. Pass `null` to inherit the day default. Requires `places:write`. |
| `get_assignment_participants` | Get users participating in a specific place assignment. Requires `places:read` or `places:write`. |
| `set_assignment_participants` | Set participants for a place assignment (replaces current list). Requires `places:write`. |

### Day Notes

Requires `trips:read` or `trips:write` scope.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_day_note` | Add a note to a specific day with optional time label and emoji icon. |
| `update_day_note` | Edit a day note's text, time, or icon. |
| `delete_day_note` | Remove a note from a day. |

### Accommodations

Requires `trips:read` or `trips:write` scope.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_accommodation` | Add an accommodation (hotel, Airbnb, etc.) linked to a place and a check-in/check-out date range. |
| `update_accommodation` | Update fields on an existing accommodation including dates, times, confirmation, and notes. |
| `delete_accommodation` | Delete an accommodation record from a trip. |

### Transport

Requires `reservations:write` scope.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_transport` | Create a transport booking in any of the nine types the transport form offers (`flight`, `train`, `bus`, `car`, `taxi`, `bicycle`, `cruise`, `ferry`, `transport_other`), with optional multi-stop endpoints, departure/arrival times, and confirmation details. Scheduled public transit goes through `create_transit_journey` instead. |
| `update_transport` | Update an existing transport booking. Pass `endpoints[]` to replace all stops. |
| `delete_transport` | Delete a transport booking from a trip. |

### Automated public transit

Transit search is powered by Transitous and uses the existing `geo:read` and `reservations:write` scopes.

| Tool | Scope required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `search_transit_stops` | `geo:read` | Search real public-transit stops and stations, optionally biased around coordinates. |
| `search_transit_routes` | `geo:read` | Search scheduled routes between two coordinates with time, mode, and transfer filters. Also returns `dropped`, the number of provider itineraries that failed validation and are absent from the results. |
| `create_transit_journey` | `reservations:write` | Save a selected route as a first-class automated transit journey on a trip day. |

### Reservations

Requires `reservations:read` or `reservations:write` scope.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_reservation` | Create a pending reservation: hotels, restaurants, events, tours, activities, and other types. Carries the booking link (`url`) and an end time. |
| `update_reservation` | Update any field including status (`pending` / `confirmed` / `cancelled`). |
| `delete_reservation` | Delete a reservation and its linked accommodation record if applicable. |
| `reorder_reservations` | Reorder reservations within a day. |
| `set_reservation_travelers` | Set who is travelling on a booking, from the trip roster (members and guests). Replaces the list; an empty array clears it. Ids that are not on the trip come back under `ignored_user_ids` rather than being attached. |
| `link_hotel_accommodation` | Set or update a hotel reservation's check-in/out day links and place. |
| `list_upcoming_reservations` | The next bookings across all of the user's trips, soonest first, for "what is coming up?" when no particular trip is in question. Hotel stays appear as their check-in and check-out moments. Cancelled bookings and archived trips are left out. `limit` defaults to 6, at most 50. Requires `reservations:read`. |

### Budget

Requires `budget:read` or `budget:write` scope. The Budget addon must be enabled; it is listed as **Costs** under **Admin → Addons** (id `budget`).

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_budget_item` | Add an expense with name, category, and price. |
| `update_budget_item` | Update an expense's details, split (persons/days), or notes. |
| `delete_budget_item` | Remove a budget item. |
| `set_budget_item_members` | Set which members are splitting a budget item (replaces current list). |
| `toggle_budget_member_paid` | Mark or unmark a member as having paid their share. |
| `get_settlement_summary` | Each member's net balance, the suggested payments to settle shared expenses, and each member's final budget (`finalBudgets`: expenses paid, net reimbursements, pending reimbursements, final cost, each figure with the rows it is made of under `sources`). `currency` says what the amounts are in: the `base` asked for when the server can quote it, otherwise the trip's base currency. An expense or payment in a foreign currency with no frozen rate, while the server has no live rate for it either, is left out of every figure and listed under `unconverted` (`item_ids`, `settlement_ids`, `currencies`). Call this before recording a settlement. |
| `list_settlements` | List the recorded settle-up payments for a trip — who paid whom, how much, and when. |
| `create_settlement` | Record a settle-up payment: one member paid another the given amount, with the payment's currency and the day it happened. |
| `update_settlement` | Update a recorded settle-up payment (payer, recipient, amount, currency and the day it happened). |
| `delete_settlement` | Delete a recorded settle-up payment. This is the undo for `create_settlement` and restores the affected balances. |
| `freeze_budget_rates` | Pin today's server exchange rate on every expense and settle-up payment in a foreign currency that has no rate frozen yet, the rows under `unconverted` included. Rows with a frozen rate, in the trip currency or without a currency are never touched, and no rate is taken from the caller. Returns the rows it froze (`items`, `settlements`) and the currencies the server could not quote (`unresolved`). Needs the budget edit permission; an error when the trip currency changed meanwhile, with nothing written. |

### Tags

Requires `places:read` or `places:write` scope.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_tags` | List all tags belonging to the current user. |
| `create_tag` | Create a new tag (user-scoped label for places) with optional hex color. |
| `update_tag` | Update the name or color of an existing tag. |
| `delete_tag` | Delete a tag (removes it from all attached places). |

### Maps & Weather

| Tool | Scope required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `get_place_details` | `geo:read` | Fetch detailed information (hours, photos, ratings) about a place by its Google Place ID. |
| `reverse_geocode` | `geo:read` | Get a human-readable address for given coordinates. |
| `resolve_maps_url` | `geo:read` | Resolve a Google Maps or Amap (高德地图) share URL to coordinates and place name. |
| `search_pois` | `geo:read` | List places of one or more categories inside a map rectangle, the MCP side of the category buttons on the trip map. Answers from TREK's place index where it can and from OpenStreetMap (Overpass) otherwise, names the source of each result, and never calls Google. |
| `search_airports` | `geo:read` | Search for airports by name, city, or IATA code. Returns IATA code, name, city, country, timezone. |
| `get_airport` | `geo:read` | Look up an airport by IATA code (e.g. `"ZRH"`, `"CDG"`). |
| `get_weather` | `weather:read` | Get a weather forecast for a location and date. |
| `get_detailed_weather` | `weather:read` | Get an hourly/detailed weather forecast for a location and date. |

### Notifications

Requires `notifications:read` or `notifications:write` scope.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_notifications` | List in-app notifications with pagination and optional unread filter. |
| `get_unread_notification_count` | Get the unread notification count. |
| `mark_notification_read` | Mark a notification as read. |
| `mark_notification_unread` | Mark a notification as unread. |
| `mark_all_notifications_read` | Mark all notifications as read. |

### Files

Requires `files:read` or `files:write`. Reading what is inside a document needs `files:content`, which is a **separate** scope and is not implied by `files:write`.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_trip_files` | List a trip's documents: name, type, size, uploader, description, what they are linked to, starred and trash state. Pass `trash` to list the trash instead. |
| `read_trip_file` | Read one document's contents. Text comes back as text, anything else base64, with an `encoding` field saying which. Files over 10 MB are refused; use the download link in the app. |
| `update_trip_file` | Set a file's description and the booking, place or expense (`budget_item_id`, a receipt) it belongs to. Pass null to detach. |
| `link_trip_file` | Link a file to one more booking, place, day assignment or expense (`budget_item_id`, a receipt). |
| `unlink_trip_file` | Remove one link. The file stays. |
| `list_trip_file_links` | List everything a file is linked to. |

### Settings

Requires `settings:read` or `settings:write`.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_display_settings` | Read the user's units, time format, language, default currency and start page. Read this before rendering a temperature, a distance or a clock time. |
| `update_display_settings` | Change one or more of those preferences. Only display preferences: API keys, map tokens and LLM settings are refused, whatever is passed. |

### Calendar feeds

Requires `trips:share`, the same scope that manages public share links.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_trip_calendar_feed` | Read the subscribable feed URL for one trip, and whether it is on. |
| `enable_trip_calendar_feed` | Turn the trip feed on and mint its token. |
| `rotate_trip_calendar_feed` | Issue a new token. Every existing subscription to that trip stops working. |
| `disable_trip_calendar_feed` | Turn it off and revoke the token. |
| `get_all_trips_calendar_feed` | The same, for the feed that carries every trip the user can see. |
| `enable_all_trips_calendar_feed` | |
| `rotate_all_trips_calendar_feed` | |
| `disable_all_trips_calendar_feed` | |

### Invite links

Requires `trips:share` together with `trips:write`; a client holding only `trips:share` does not see these three tools. This is the link that grants **membership**, not the read-only public view link that `create_share_link` makes.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_trip_invite_link` | Read the current invite link and when it expires. |
| `create_trip_invite_link` | Mint an invite link, optionally with an expiry. Rotating replaces the old one, which stops working. |
| `delete_trip_invite_link` | Revoke it. |

Accepting an invite has no tool on purpose: joining somebody's trip is a human act.

### Imports

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_airtrail_flights` | List the flights available to import from a connected AirTrail account. Requires the AirTrail addon. |
| `import_airtrail_flights` | Import chosen flights into a trip as transport bookings. |

### Photos

Requires `journey:read`, or `journey:write` to attach. Needs a configured Immich or Synology Photos provider.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `search_provider_photos` | Search the connected photo library. |
| `list_provider_albums` | List its albums. |
| `list_provider_album_photos` | List one album's photos. |
| `add_journey_provider_photos` | Attach photos from the library to a journey, or to one of its entries, by the asset ids the tools above return. Requires `journey:write` and the Journey addon; listed under [MCP-Addon-Tools](MCP-Addon-Tools). |

Photo bytes are never returned: those are image URLs the app renders.

### Help and instance

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_help_topics` | List the bundled help pages. Answers "how do I do X in TREK?" without guessing. |
| `get_help_page` | Read one help page. |
| `list_addons` | Which addons and collaboration features this instance has enabled. Worth calling when a tool you expected is not in the list: an addon that is off removes its tools exactly the way a missing scope does. |
| `get_trip_warnings` | Warnings plugins have raised about a trip. A plugin raising one is telling the user something is wrong, so it is worth reading before reviewing an itinerary. |
