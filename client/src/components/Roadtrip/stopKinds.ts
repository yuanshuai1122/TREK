/**
 * One row per kind of stop a drive can have, and the only place a new one is added.
 *
 * The six kinds used to be written out in nine separate lists: the enum in `@trek/shared`,
 * `SERVICE_STOP_TYPES` and `SERVICE_COLORS` here in the model, the corridor's category
 * keys, the map's `ROADTRIP_POI_CATEGORIES`, the popup's own `STOP_KINDS`, two lookups in
 * the rail, one in the map markers and one in the corridor panel. Every one of those
 * carried a comment telling the next person to keep the others in step, and it still came
 * apart: a rest area was a parking sign in the popup, on the map pill and in the panel,
 * and a coffee cup on the rail disc and the map marker, for the same stop. That is fixed
 * here in favour of the parking sign, because the colour is already documented as "the
 * blue every parking sign in Europe is printed in".
 *
 * The table lives beside the model rather than in it because an icon is a React component
 * and `roadtripModel.ts` is deliberately free of React so it can be unit tested on its
 * own. The colours and the service list stay there and are read from here.
