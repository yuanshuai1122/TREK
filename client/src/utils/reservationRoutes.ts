 * Whether a hop is worth drawing at the current zoom.
 *
 * The declutter exists for a tiny straight connector, the kind that would sit
 * under its own endpoint markers and add nothing but clutter. It used to be
 * decided from the two endpoints alone, which was fine while every hop was a
 * straight line: the line was never longer than the gap it bridged.
 *
 * A routed car booking is not that line. It follows the road, and a road that
 * leaves a town, loops round a lake and comes back to the next town along
 * can run across half the screen while its two ends project a handful of
 * pixels apart. The old check then hid the whole drive, and the person looking
 * at their trip saw a gap in the route until they zoomed in far enough for
 * the endpoints to separate (#2275). A booking with stops on the way has the
 * same shape: the ends may be close, the drawn path is not.
 *
 * So the decision looks at what will actually be drawn. A hop stays hidden
 * only while every polyline it would draw is shorter on screen than the
 * floor, walked point to point. A straight two-point line measures the same
 * as before, so every existing floor holds for the case it was written for.
 *
 * `project` is whichever renderer's own projection: Leaflet's
 * latLngToContainerPoint or Mapbox's project, wrapped to take [lat, lng].
