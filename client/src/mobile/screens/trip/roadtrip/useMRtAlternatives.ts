 * Other ways of driving a leg, as a phone asks for them and takes one.
 *
 * Holds no picker state of its own. The road trip tab is mounted in two places, one per
 * half of the list and map switch, so it remounts on every toggle, and a picker living
 * here would be gone the moment somebody looked back at the chain. Everything stays in
 * the planner, where the desk keeps it too: the open leg, the offers, the overlays and
 * the road lit on the map. What this adds is what a desk does not need.
 *
 * A tap previews and a confirm takes. On the desk a pointer hovers to preview and a
 * click writes; glass has no hover, so the first touch on a chip or a line would already
 * be the write. Here that touch only lights the road (`pick`), and the bar's button
 * commits it (`confirm`).
 *
 * The question is always about the leg on screen. Asking goes to the map, where the
 * answer is drawn, and a stage change closes the picker, because offers drawn for a leg
 * of another day are lines nobody on this stage asked about.
