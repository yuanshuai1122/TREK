/**
 * Graceful shutdown sequence (#2193).
 *
 * The reported symptom was a container that exited 137 exactly ten seconds
 * after every `docker stop`. The cause was that nothing in the shutdown path
 * could release a WebSocket: `http.Server.close()` waits for open connections
 * and an upgraded socket never ends on its own, so the close callback — which
 * is where `closeDb()` and `process.exit(0)` lived — never ran, and the only
 * remaining exit was a fallback timer set to the very second Docker sends
 * SIGKILL.
 *
 * These tests pin the three things that fix required: the sockets are actively
 * released, the database is closed on BOTH exit paths, and the fallback timer
 * fires inside Docker's 10s grace rather than on top of it.
