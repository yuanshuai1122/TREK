# trek-plugin-sdk

The SDK for building [TREK](https://github.com/liketrek/TREK) plugins.

The path is four commands: **`create` → `dev` → `status` → `publish`**. Everything
else the CLI can do is a step one of those already does for you.

## Scaffold a plugin

```bash
npx trek-plugin-sdk                        # no command? a guided menu of everything below
npx trek-plugin-sdk create                 # interactive wizard (id, type, icon, permissions, egress)
npx trek-plugin-sdk create my-plugin --type widget   # or non-interactive
cd my-plugin
```

The wizard asks for the id, type, icon (validated against lucide), permissions,
egress hosts and required addons, and offers to initialize a git repo and install
dependencies for you. In a non-interactive shell (CI, pipes) every command stays
flag-driven with plain output — no prompts, and machine output (`entry` JSON,
`pack --json`, PR URLs) stays on stdout.

What you get **runs and packs immediately** — but it is not publishable yet: the
README is a template and there is no screenshot. That is deliberate. Writing those
is your job, and `status` tells you exactly what is left.

## Develop with a live reload loop

`dev` runs your plugin locally — no full TREK needed. It injects a `ctx` that
enforces exactly the permissions your manifest grants (an ungranted call throws
`PERMISSION_DENIED`, so you catch missing grants), backs `db:own` with a real
SQLite file, serves your routes and your page/widget UI, and reloads on save.

```bash
npx trek-plugin-sdk dev        # http://localhost:4317 — dashboard, routes, UI
```

Open **`/preview`** to see a page/widget rendered in a real sandboxed frame with a
theme/accent/appearance toggle (`trek.invoke()` is proxied to your routes). Hit a route
as an unauthenticated request with `?_anon=1`. Drop a `dev-fixtures.json` (trips, users,
config) next to your manifest to feed `ctx.trips` / `ctx.users`.

## Know where you are

```bash
npx trek-plugin-sdk status        # never fails — it's a map, not a gate
```

`status` runs every check the TREK-Plugins registry enforces that can be answered
without a network — which is nearly all of them — and prints the whole journey as a
checklist grouped by stage (Manifest, Code, Docs, Release, Repo): what passes, what
does not, and the **one** command to run next. Run it whenever you are not sure what
to do; it deliberately never exits non-zero.

`validate` is the same checks with an exit code. It is the form for scripts and CI;
`status` is the form for humans. A plugin that passes `validate` will pass every
registry gate that does not require the tag and the release to exist — those four
run in `preflight`, which `publish` does for you.

## Build a native UI (page / widget)

The UI is a sandboxed, opaque-origin iframe that can't load TREK's stylesheet — so the
SDK ships it. Put **one line** in your `client/index.html` `<head>`:

```html
<!-- trek:ui -->
```

`dev` and `pack` expand it into the inlined **design kit**: token-driven styles that
follow the host's theme and accent (glass, cards, `.trek-btn`, `.trek-input`,
`.trek-chip`, `.trek-row`, hover), plus a `window.trek` bridge:

```js
trek.onContext((ctx) => { /* ctx.theme, ctx.tokens, ctx.appearance, ctx.user, ctx.tripId */ })
const data = await trek.invoke('/status')   // calls your own route, host-proxied
trek.notify('success', 'Saved')
```

### Keep UI state for this browser tab

The opaque frame cannot use browser storage directly. The bridge provides
host-managed, JSON-only session state instead. It survives an iframe remount and
page reload in the same browser tab, but is not durable data. Do not use it to
store secrets.

```js
// Default: this user + this plugin + this browser tab.
await trek.session.set('dismissed-onboarding', true)
const dismissed = await trek.session.get('dismissed-onboarding')

// Explicitly partition state by the trip in view (fails without a trip context).
await trek.session.set('filters', ['flight', 'hotel'], { scope: 'trip' })
```

`get()` returns `undefined` for a missing key. `set`, `get`, `remove`, and
`clear` accept `{ scope: 'plugin' | 'trip' }`; `plugin` is the default. Use your
plugin's own logical key (for example `reservation:88:expanded`) for any finer
partitioning. Each plugin or individual trip scope is limited to 32 keys,
64 characters per key, and 1 KiB per JSON value.

The kit applies the theme, mirrors the appearance flags (reduced-motion,
no-transparency) and auto-reports your height. It also upgrades any native
`<select>` into a host-styled, keyboard-accessible dropdown that matches TREK —
the OS-drawn popup never could. Write a plain `<select>` and it just works; add
`data-trek-native` to opt a field out. See the
[Plugin Development wiki](https://github.com/liketrek/TREK/wiki/Plugin-Development)
for the full component + token reference.

## Write a plugin

```js
const { definePlugin } = require('trek-plugin-sdk')

module.exports = definePlugin({
  async onLoad(ctx) {
    await ctx.db.migrate('001', 'CREATE TABLE cache (k TEXT PRIMARY KEY, v TEXT)')
  },
  routes: [
    { method: 'GET', path: '/status', auth: true, async handler(req, ctx) {
      return { status: 200, headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }, body: '{"ok":true}' }
    }},
  ],
})
```

Your plugin runs in an **isolated child process**. `ctx` is the only way to reach
TREK, and it grants exactly the permissions your `trek-plugin.json` declares — an
ungranted call throws `PERMISSION_DENIED`.

## Settings

Declare settings in `trek-plugin.json`; TREK renders the form, you write no settings UI.

```json
"settings": [
  { "key": "api_url", "label": "API URL", "default": "https://api.example", "required": true },
  { "key": "retries", "label": "Retries", "input_type": "number", "default": 3 },
  { "key": "api_key", "label": "API key", "scope": "user", "secret": true, "required": true },
  { "key": "region", "label": "Region", "input_type": "select",
    "options": [{ "value": "eu", "label": "EU" }, { "value": "us", "label": "US" }], "default": "eu" }
]
```

| Attribute | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `key` | Identifier (`^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{0,63}$`). |
| `scope` | `instance` (default) — set once by the admin, arrives in `ctx.config`. `user` — per user, read with `await ctx.settings.get(key)`. |
| `input_type` | `text` (default), `password`, `number`, `checkbox`, `select` (with `options`). |
| `default` | The field's value wherever nobody set one. The form pre-fills it **and the runtime resolves it** — `ctx.config.api_url` / `ctx.settings.get('region')` return it until someone saves something else — so a plugin with sensible defaults works before anyone opens the form. Satisfies `required`. Not allowed on a `secret` (the manifest is public); must be a boolean on a `checkbox` and one of the `options` when declared. `trek-plugin dev` seeds its fixtures from these too. |
| `required` | Enforced: the form refuses Save while the field is blank, and the host answers `400 { error: 'Missing required setting "<key>"' }` if a save reaches it anyway. A `checkbox` is exempt (that would be consent, not a setting). A required `scope:'user'` field also gates whether a notification channel dispatches to that user. |
| `secret` | Encrypted at rest, decrypted only into the server-side `ctx.config` / `ctx.settings`, masked to the browser, never sent to the iframe. |
| `label`, `placeholder`, `hint` | Form text. |
| `options` | `[{ "value", "label" }]` for a `select` (bare strings are accepted and coerced). |
| `oauth` | Descriptive metadata only — for a host-brokered flow see the OAuth broker below. |

Any other attribute is **silently dropped at install**. `trek-plugin validate` warns on
one (`manifest.settings-known-keys`) so a typo like `"defalt"` doesn't quietly do nothing.

### Actions

Up to 8 buttons the host renders on a settings form, declared in `trek-plugin.json`
and implemented in `definePlugin({ actions: { <key>: async (ctx) => ({ ok, message }) } })`:

```json
"actions": [
  { "key": "testConnection", "label": "Test connection", "hint": "Pings the API." },
  { "key": "purgeCache", "label": "Purge cache", "scope": "instance", "danger": true }
]
```

| Attribute | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `scope` | `user` (default) — renders on the user Settings tab and runs as the clicking user. `instance` — renders in the admin instance-settings dialog and runs as the clicking admin. The default differs from settings fields on purpose: existing manifests keep their user-tab buttons. A host older than TREK 4.2.0 (which introduced action scope) ignores this field entirely and renders the button on every user's Settings tab, running it as each user — so if you declare `scope: "instance"`, set the manifest's `trek` range floor to `>=4.2.0` or the button will run in the wrong place on an older host. |
| `danger` | Rendered destructive; the host asks for confirmation first. |
| `hint` | Shown beside the button (≤ 200 chars). |

Either way the handler gets the clicking person as acting user: `ctx.config` is the
instance config, `ctx.settings.get()` returns their own user value, and trip reads are
membership-checked against them. Return `{ ok, message }` or throw to report a failed
action (the host shows the message, emoji-stripped, ≤ 200 chars). An instance action is
disabled in the dialog until the plugin is active — there is no child process to run it.
In the mock host, pass `declaredActions: ['testConnection', { key: 'purgeCache', scope: 'instance' }]`
and drive either with `drv.action(key)`.

`ctx.config` is frozen at activation — the host re-spawns the plugin when the admin
saves. `ctx.settings.get()` is live per call and returns `undefined` in a userless
context (`onLoad`, jobs, scheduler) — fall back to `ctx.config` there.

## Test without a running TREK

```js
import { createMockHost } from 'trek-plugin-sdk/testing'

const { ctx, broadcasts } = createMockHost({
  grants: ['db:read:trips', 'ws:broadcast:trip'],
  trips: { 1: { members: [42], data: { id: 1, name: 'Japan' } } },
})
// the mock enforces the SAME permission model, so you can prove your plugin
// degrades gracefully when a permission is missing.
```

## Runtime limits

The host enforces these limits on every ctx call and hook invocation. They are generous
for a legitimate plugin and only bite a runaway or abusive one — build against them so
`dev`/`mock-host` behavior matches production.

| Area | Limit |
|---|---|
| `ctx.ai` | 200 calls/day per plugin (UTC midnight rollover); past it throws `"daily AI budget exhausted (resets at UTC midnight)"` |
| `ctx.notify` | 100 calls/day per plugin (UTC midnight rollover); past it throws `"daily notification budget exhausted (resets at UTC midnight)"` |
| RPC (every `ctx.*` call) | burst 60, sustained 20/s, 16 in-flight per plugin; a throttled call is refused with `HOST_ERROR: rate limit exceeded — slow down ctx.* calls` |
| `ctx.db` (your own sqlite) | 256 MB per plugin |
| `ctx.meta` | 64 KB per value, 256 chars per key, 100 keys per (plugin, entity) |
| Plugin process | 300 MB RSS ceiling; auto-disabled after 5 crashes in 5 minutes |
| Event redelivery buffer | 200 events held per plugin, dropped unreplayed after 15 minutes |

Hook contribution caps (declarative content the host renders — a slow/failing call is
skipped, never fatal):

| Hook | Cap |
|---|---|
| `pdfSectionProvider` | ≤5 sections per provider |
| `atlasLayerProvider` | ≤3 layers per provider |
| `mapMarkerProvider` | ≤200 markers per provider |
| `warningProvider` | ≤20 warnings per provider, each message ≤300 chars |
| `placeDetailProvider` | ≤12 items per provider |
| `searchProvider` | ≤20 places per provider, 2 s to answer |
| `photoProvider` | ≤60 photos per page |
| `calendarSource` | ≤500 events per source per request |
| `tableContributor` | ≤20 columns / ≤10 actions per entity |
| `tripCardProvider` | ≤4 badges per trip, ≤240 total per provider |

## OAuth broker

`ctx.oauth.getAccessToken()` is host-brokered outbound OAuth: the plugin never becomes a
direct OAuth client. The host runs the whole flow (authorize → callback → token exchange
→ refresh) with PKCE and a 10-minute state TTL, and holds the refresh token + client
secret — a plugin only ever sees a short-lived access token for the ACTING USER, or
`null` when they haven't connected (or in a userless context).

Provider config is the plugin's admin-owned INSTANCE settings — declare `scope:'instance'`
manifest fields named `oauth_authorize_url`, `oauth_token_url`, `oauth_scopes` (optional),
`oauth_client_id`, `oauth_client_secret`, and the admin fills them in from Settings →
Plugins → Connect. Both endpoint URLs must be `https` and may not point at loopback,
`.local`/`.internal` names, or private/metadata addresses — the host refuses to start a
flow against them. The host exposes
`/api/plugin-oauth/:id/status|connect|callback|disconnect` to drive the connect UI;
plugin code itself only ever calls `getAccessToken()`.

## Capture the screenshot

The registry requires a screenshot that resolves to a real image, and the store card
shows it. `shot` boots the dev server, renders your plugin in the same themed frame
TREK uses, and writes a 1600×900 `docs/screenshot.png`:

```bash
npm i -D playwright && npx playwright install chromium   # once
npx trek-plugin-sdk shot                                 # --dark for the dark theme
```

Playwright is deliberately **not** a dependency of this SDK — it ships a browser, and
most authors never need one. An `integration` plugin has no UI to render, so `shot`
cannot help; screenshot the TREK surface your plugin changes instead.

## Publish — one command

Commit and push your plugin to its public GitHub repo, then:

```bash
npx trek-plugin-sdk publish --repo you/repo --tag v1.0.0
```

`publish` is the whole release, in five steps and in this order:

1. **check** — every registry gate that can be checked locally
2. **pack** — build `plugin.zip`
3. **release** — git tag, push, and cut the GitHub release with the artifact
4. **preflight** — the gates that need the tag and the release to exist
5. **submit** — open the PR against the TREK-Plugins registry

Step 1 comes first for a reason: a GitHub release is effectively immutable, because
the registry pins its sha256. If a check fails, **nothing is packed, tagged, pushed
or released** — so you can fix it and re-run against the same version. (`--no-checks`
skips step 1; it is an escape hatch for a re-run, never right on a first publish.)

Needs `git` and an authenticated `gh`. It prints the PR URL at the end.

**Updating** a listed plugin: bump `version` in the manifest, commit, and run
`publish` again with the new tag — it detects the existing entry and prepends the
new version, newest-first. Your TREK-Plugins fork is fast-forwarded automatically
before the PR branch is cut, so a fork left behind doesn't break the submit (a
*diverged* fork gets a warning and the `gh repo sync --force` command to fix it).

### When a publish fails

A failure **after** the release is cut (a preflight or PR problem) rolls back
exactly what that run created — the GitHub release, the pushed tag, the local
tag — so the same tag is free to re-run against once you've fixed the problem.
Nothing that existed before the run is ever touched. Pass `--keep-release` to
keep the release instead; the error then prints the manual cleanup commands.

Two related conveniences:

- A leftover tag from an earlier failed run (it has no release and doesn't point
  at `HEAD`) is recognised as debris and **moved to your current commit** instead
  of silently releasing the stale one.
- `trek-plugin unrelease <vX.Y.Z> --repo you/repo` deletes a stranded release +
  remote tag + local tag in one go. It checks the published registry index first
  and **refuses to touch a version that is actually published** — those artifacts
  are immutable (the registry pins their sha256), so the only way forward there is
  a new version.

Prefer to drive the steps yourself? They still exist individually — `pack`,
`release` (pack → GitHub release → entry), `preflight`, `submit` (opens the PR),
and `entry` (just prints the JSON).

### Signing (recommended — `publish` offers it)

In a terminal, `publish` **asks** whether to sign, and creates the key for you if you
have none — you don't have to know `--sign` or `keygen` exist. Scripts and CI are never
prompted: pass `--sign`.

A signature proves the artifact came from **you**, not just that its bytes match what
the registry saw. Signing is dependency-free Ed25519 over the artifact bytes.

It is a one-way door you may walk through **late**:

- Unsigned throughout is fine — the sha256 pin is the only guarantee, and TREK accepts it.
- **Unsigned → signed later breaks nobody.** Nothing is pinned until a signed version
  installs, so adding a key at v1.4.0 is a real option, not a lost cause. The registry
  does require every version signed once your key appears in the entry — your first
  signed update **retro-signs the older versions for you** (each pinned artifact is
  downloaded, verified against its sha256, and signed with the same key).
- **Signed → unsigned is refused forever**, on every instance that already has the plugin.
  `publish` refuses that at step 1, before anything is tagged or released.

So **back the key up** (`~/.trek-plugin/signing.key`). Losing it means you cannot ship an
update to your own plugin without a registry maintainer override.

```bash
npx trek-plugin-sdk publish --repo you/repo --tag v1.1.0 --sign   # or just answer the prompt
```

## Exports

- `definePlugin(def)` + all the plugin types (`PluginContext`, `PluginRoute`, `PluginJob`, `PhotoProvider`, `CalendarSource`).
- `PLUGIN_API_VERSION` — embed as `apiVersion` in your manifest.
- `validateManifest(json)` — the manifest rules the server loader uses.
- `settingDefaults(manifest, scope)` — the `default`s of one settings scope, keyed by field: what the host resolves for an unset field, and what `dev` seeds `ctx.config` / `ctx.settings` with. Spread it under your own fixtures when calling `createMockHost` to mirror the host. `SETTING_FIELD_KEYS` is the attribute list the host stores.
- `createMockHost(opts)` (from `trek-plugin-sdk/testing`).
- `TREK_UI_CSS`, `TREK_THEME_JS`, `TREK_UI_MARKER`, `injectTrekUi(html)` — the design kit, for authors who inline it themselves (a bundler, a custom build). Most plugins just use the `<!-- trek:ui -->` marker instead.

## Commands

Run any of these with `npx trek-plugin-sdk <command>` (or the short `trek-plugin`
bin if you install the package). `trek-plugin help <command>` — or
`trek-plugin <command> --help` — prints a full page for any of them.

**The path:**

- `create [name] [--type t] [--template blank|notification-channel] [--interactive]` — scaffold a plugin; a wizard if you omit the name.
- `dev [dir] [--port 4317]` — run locally with a real request loop, SQLite `db:own`, and hot reload.
- `status [dir]` — where am I? what's left? Every offline registry gate as a checklist, plus the next command. Never fails.
- `publish [dir] --repo o/n --tag vX [--sign [key]] [--no-checks] [--no-preflight]` — **the lot**: check → pack → release → preflight → open the PR. In a terminal it offers to sign (and makes you a key); scripts pass `--sign`.

**Also:**

- `validate [dir]` — the gate: the same checks as `status`, but it exits non-zero.
- `pack [dir] [--out plugin.zip] [--json]` — build the artifact, print `sha256` + `size`. Refuses a plugin that could not *load*; does not enforce the publish gates, because packing is how you sideload a plugin to try it.
- `shot [dir] [--port 4317] [--out docs/screenshot.png] [--dark] [--no-serve]` — capture `docs/screenshot.png`. Needs Playwright.
- `keygen [--key file]` — create an Ed25519 signing key.
- `sign [zip] [--key file]` — print a signature + public key for an artifact.
- `entry --repo o/n --tag vX [--merge f] [--sign [key]] [--out f]` — emit the registry entry JSON.
- `preflight [dir] --repo o/n --tag vX [--entry f] [--all]` — the registry checks that need the network: the tag resolves to the pinned commit, the released artifact downloads and hashes, the id is not bound to another owner, and an update does not drop or rotate a published signing key.
- `submit [dir] --repo o/n --tag vX [--registry o/n] [--draft]` — open the registry PR for you.
- `release [dir] --repo o/n --tag vX [--sign [key]] [--merge f]` — pack → GitHub release → entry, without opening the PR.
- `unrelease <vX.Y.Z> [dir] --repo o/n [--yes]` — delete a stranded release + remote tag + local tag. Refuses a version that is published in the registry (immutable); `--yes` consents when the registry index can't be checked.

## Update notice

Both CLIs (`trek-plugin` and `create-trek-plugin`) tell you when a newer SDK has been
published. This matters more than the usual "you're on an old version" nag: the
registry entry format, the manifest rules and the permission catalog all move with the
TREK host, so a stale SDK can `pack` and `submit` an entry that today's registry CI
rejects.

It is powered by [`update-notifier`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/update-notifier),
the standard for npm CLIs:

- At most **once every 24 hours**, a detached background process asks
  `registry.npmjs.org` for this package's `latest` version and caches the answer under
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/configstore/` (or `~/.config/…`).
- Your command **never waits for it** — the notice is printed from that cache, so a
  fresh install learns about an update on a later run.
- The notice goes to **stderr**, so `pack --json` and `entry` keep piping clean JSON.

The request is an unauthenticated GET for a public package — the same one `npm install`
makes (npm's servers see your IP, as for any download). TREK has no telemetry, and this
isn't any. To turn it off:

```bash
export NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1
```

It is already silent in CI (any `CI` env var), under `NODE_ENV=test`, and whenever
stdout isn't a terminal (i.e. when piped or redirected).

The SDK tooling in this repo is MIT. Your plugin is your own code under your own license.

### Roadtrip category searches

The `searchProvider.search` request can include `category` and `bounds` (south, west, north, east). Search within that rectangle for the category; `query` remains a readable category query and `near` its centre, so existing providers continue to work. These optional fields are absent on older hosts and ordinary name searches. The host validates and filters coordinates, namespaces IDs, and applies the exact route corridor after combining sources. The existing permission and two-second hook timeout still apply.
